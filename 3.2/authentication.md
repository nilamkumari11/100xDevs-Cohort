# Hashing
- Converting simple string into some texts so that when passwords are stored in db then it is not read by anyone.
- one way
- given the o/p no one give i/p
- changing i/p lil bit changes o/p a lot

# Encryption
- string is converted to some complecated string using a key then it can also be converted back to the string form.
- encrypted and decrypted 
- for deccription it requires a key (password)
- two way
- string encrypted using a pass
- decrypted using same pass

# JSON web tokens
- JSON : Hashing for json only
- its neither encryption or hashing
- its technically a digital signature
- anyone ca see original o/p given sign
- sign can be verified only using pass
- web : used in web
- token : it return s a token at the end
- here any one can decode to hashed thing but only one eith the access of password can verify it with the original string


# local storage 
- place in browser where we can store some data  
- usually things that are stored include :
1. Authentication tokens
2. User language preference
3. User theme preference
